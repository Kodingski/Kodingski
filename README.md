Graduate in 'Statistics and Data Science' at Leiden University.
I share some of my academic and personal projects here.

Recently finalized my Master Thesis project, introducing an improved possession metric in football by adding spatio-temporal context. 
The report of the thesis, as well as code for the reproduction of all results can be found in the repository.

Our team took 8th place in the 2021 edition of the annual Generative Design in Minecraft competition (https://gendesignmc.engineering.nyu.edu/) as part of an university group project. We developed an algorithm that generates a village in the style of an old Dutch town, adapting to the environment given. My main contribution was the development of an algorithm to find a suitable location for our village inside the given landscape. The algorithm uses image filters on a 2d-representation of the world to find the optimal spot.

Other fields of interest include Bayesian Statistics, Machine Learning and Economics.
