Master Student from Germany living in Leiden, graduating in 'Statistics and Data Science' at Leiden University.
I share some of my academic and personal projects here. Many of them are related to Football Data Science.

Currently finalizing my Master Thesis project, introducing an improved possession metric in football by adding spatio-temporal context. 
The final draft of the thesis can be found in the repository.

Our team took 8th place in the 2021 edition of the annual Generative Design in Minecraft competition (https://gendesignmc.engineering.nyu.edu/) as part of an university group project. We developed an algorithm that generates a village in the style of an old Dutch town, adapting to the environment given. My main contribution was the development of an algorithm to find a suitable location for our village inside the given landscape. The algorithm uses image filters on a 2d-representation of the world to find the optimal spot.

Also one of the most winning players in the real money live fantasy football manager Spitch.
The repository containing the code used for my analysis of the game including the web crawler to obtain my data are private for obvious reasons,
if other players or potential employers are interesterd in my work there, feel free to contact me.

Other fields of interest include Bayesian Statistics, Machine Learning and Economics.
